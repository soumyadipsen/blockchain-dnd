The Do Not Disturb feature mutes all calls, alerts, and notifications on your mobile device. You have the option of customizing which notifications, alerts, or calls you wish to have to go through when the Do Not Disturb option is selected. 

There's no reason to let your phone control your life. Using the Do Not Disturb feature, you can set the hours that you let messages and notifications steal your attention. And you can customize the settings so specific people can reach you regardless of whether Do Not Disturb is on or not. 

When Do Not Disturb is turned on, it sends incoming calls to voicemail and does not alert you about calls or text messages. It also silences all notifications, so youâ€™re not disturbed by the phone. You might want to enable Do Not Disturb mode when you go to bed, or during meals, meetings, and movies. 

The Do Not Disturb system adopts Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology that allows only registered users to participate in telemarketing. 

The blockchain technology will ensure traceability and bring in accountability for all the unsolicited phone spamming by miscreants. The main feature of Blockchain technology will be to identify and penalize those telemarketers who keep switching numbers so that they can continue to spam. Due to the identification of such telemarketers 4 
and organizations by the Blockchain system, and the heavy penalties issued on them, such people will refrain from creating unregistered numbers to spam. 

The proposed DnD system will also capture customer consent for information and authorized telemarketing agencies, the new technology-based norms will record all communication between subscribers and entities. The system will also check the unscrupulous methods that telemarketers use such as registering with telecom companies to obtain subscriber details. With this, only authorized agencies will be able to access details of only those subscribers who have agreed to receive the message and deliver the service.
